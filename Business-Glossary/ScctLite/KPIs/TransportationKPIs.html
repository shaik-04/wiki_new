<h1><strong>Transportation KPIs</strong></h1>
<p>Transportation KPIs help businesses analyze shipments, rates, and the constraints to produce realistic load plans that reduce overall freight spend and gain efficiencies across entire transportation networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Fleet Space Utilization KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Fleet Space Utilization is the measurement of used space against the total fleet space in volume. This KPI is calculated by</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Used Space / Total Fleet Space)</i></p>
<h6><strong>2. Fleet Capacity Utilization KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Fleet Capacity Utilization is the measure of the demand against the fleet capacity.</p>
<p>This KPI is calculated by</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Demand / Fleet Capacity)</i></p>
<h6><strong>3. On Time Delivery KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>On-time final delivery, also known as on-time delivery (OTD), is the ratio of products delivered on-time or before to customers compared to the total number of shipped products. The KPI measures supply chain efficiency and performance in delivery operations. The units shipped on time are for the whole order, not broken down by piece. The formula for On Time Delivery KPI is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Orders delivered on time) / (Total Orders) × 100</i></p>
<h6><strong>4. Average Days Late KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Average days late is the number of days between the delivery's due date and when the customer receives the order. The formula for calculation is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Delay in days of late shipment/Count of late shipments</i></p>
<h6><strong>5.Freight Cost per Unit Shipped KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Freight cost per unit shipped is the total freight costs divided by the number of units shipped in the period. The measurement considers things like cargo mix and making sure the container is not underloaded. This KPI is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Cost of freight/No of units)</i></p>
<h6><strong>6. Average Inbound Transportation Cost KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Measures the cost of bringing a product into a facility as a percentage of sales or cost of goods sold (COGS). The inbound transportation cost is generally included in COGS. It is useful to separate this cost by supplier. The formula to calculate this KPI is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Cost of bringing Product in Facility / COGS)</i></p>
<h6><strong>7. Average Outbound Transportation Cost KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>It measures the cost of sending products out of a facility to the customer. Ideally, this cost should be measured per unit shipped, but it is often measured as a percentage of sales. It is useful to separate this metric by customer. This is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Cost of sending Product out of Facility / COGS)</i></p>
<h6><strong>8.&nbsp;Transit Time to Distance KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>The transit time to distance compares the distance a shipment travels to the time it takes it to go from pickup to destination. The formula for calculation is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Time to go from pickup to destination) / Total Distance)</i></p>
<h6><strong>9. Gross Margin ROI KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>GMROI shows how much a company made compared to how much it invested in stock purchases. This metric measures how efficiently a company buys and sells its products. The formula for calculation is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Gross margin&nbsp;/&nbsp;average inventory cost</i></p>
<h6><strong>10.&nbsp;Transportation Cost per Weight KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Cost per weight is the cost of a shipment compared to its weight. This measure is used to compare carriers, weekly invoices and individual shipments.&nbsp;This KPI is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Cost of shipment) / (Weight of shipment)</i></p>
<h6><strong>11.&nbsp;Transportation Cost per Distance KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Cost per distance calculates the profit distribution for a load. The measurement is the total monthly expenses or total load cost compared to distance driven. The prices are fixed and variable. The formula is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Transportation Cost per Weight / Total Distance)</i></p>
<h6><strong>12.&nbsp;Transportation Cost per Weight per Distance KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>It Calculates the cost obtained per weight against the distance driven. This KPI is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(No of days product is out of stock&nbsp;/&nbsp;365) x&nbsp;100</i></p>
<h6><strong>13.&nbsp;Average Truck Idle Time KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Idle time occurs when the fleet vehicles’ engines are running, but the vehicle isn’t in motion. It is the time basically between loading and unloading. The formula is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Total idle time/ Total number of trips)</i></p>
<h6><strong>14.&nbsp;Truck Turn-around Time&nbsp;KPI:&nbsp;</strong></h6>
<p>Truck turnaround time is the total time spent by a truck in the terminal area. From gate-in to gate-out for picking and/or dropping a container. It includes the time from the arrival, loading, and unloading of containers, inspecting a truck, completing documentation, and going out from the terminal. The smaller the truck turning rates, the more time the truck is on the road. This rate shows how well a company handles loading and unloading. This KPI&nbsp;is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Truck Exit time - Truck Arrival time)</i></p>
<h6><strong>15.&nbsp;Loading-Unloading Time KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>The average time in hours it takes a carrier to load and unload freight. Long loading or unloading times can rsult in the need to reroute existing shipments, leave other trucks/vehicles in dead-time or worse.</p>
<h6><strong>16. Average Inbound Shipment Size KPI:&nbsp;</strong></h6>
<p>It measures the average number of units or dollars in each incoming shipment at a facility. The formula for calculation is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Average Units/Dollars in Inbound Shipment)</i></p>
<h6><strong>17. Average Outbound Shipment Size KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>It measures the average number of units or dollars on each outbound shipment at a facility. Obsolete Inventory KPI is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Average Units/Dollars in Outbound Shipment)</i></p>
<h6><strong>18. Out-of-Network Shipment (%) KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Out-of-network shipments are the unusual shipments ordered due to stock depletion. These shipments can be expensive. The ratio of out-of-network shipments compares them to total shipments. Inventory Shrinkage KPI is calculated by:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Total out-of-network shipments) / (total shipments) × 100</i></p>
<h6><strong>19.&nbsp;Average Dwell Time KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Average dwell time, also known as wait time, is the length of time a carrier sits before processing pickup and delivery.</p>
<h6><strong>20.&nbsp;Number of Shipments KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>The number of shipments is a metric representing the monthly count of how many shipments a company sends. This can be broken down by region, country or product type. The totals will show the seasonal fluctuations and help companies prepare and allocate resources over the year.</p>

<p>It is the total number of deliveries carried per truck.</p>
<h6><strong>24.&nbsp;Fraction Transported by Mode KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>It measures the fraction of transportation (in units or dollars) using each mode of transportation. This metric can be used to estimate if certain modes are overused or underutilized. The formula for calculation is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Fraction calculated in Units/Dollars in each mode)</i></p>
<h6><strong>25.On Time Arrival KPI:</strong></h6>
