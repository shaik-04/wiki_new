<h1><strong>Inventory KPIs</strong></h1>
<p>Inventory KPIs help businesses balance capital investment objectives &amp; constraints, and service-level goals over a large assortment of stock-keeping units (SKUs) while taking demand and supply volatility into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Average Inventory KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>The amount (in units) of inventory a company has on-hand during a given time period. Average Inventory KPI is calculated by</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Beginning inventory&nbsp;+&nbsp;ending inventory) /&nbsp;2</i></p>
<h6><strong>2. Gross Inventory KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>The actual cost of merchandise, materials, and items bought or obtained by business to create the products.</p>
<p>Gross Inventory KPI is calculated by</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Qty per SKU * Std cost of SKU)</i></p>
<h6><strong>3. Inventory Accuracy KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Inventory accuracy refers to the match between the amount of inventory that has been tracked and the amount that is physically present in a warehouse. The formula for Inventory Accuracy KPI is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Inventory tracked by system / Physically present inventory) * 100</i></p>
<h5><strong>4. Carrying Cost of Inventory KPI:</strong></h5>
<p>It is the total amount of money a business spends on owning, storing, and holding inventory (also known as Holding Cost). The costs include warehouse, insurance, rent, labor, and any unsellable products. The total cost depends on which products a company carries, the number of SKUs, the storage location, the inventory turnover rate and whether the company used a third-party fulfillment company. The formula for calculation is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>[(inventory service costs + inventory risk costs + capital cost + storage cost)] / Total inventory value</i></p>
<h6><strong>5. Inventory Turnover Ratio KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Inventory turnover is the frequency at which your inventory is being sold. A higher value indicates stronger, and a lower value indicates weaker sales. Inventory Turnover Ratio KPI is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Cost of goods sold / Average inventory)</i></p>
<h6><strong>6. Inventory to Sales Ratio KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Provides the ratio of the remaining inventory at the end of the month to the sales made during the same month. It Predict potential cash flow issues before they become a problem, by showing when rising inventory levels coincide with falling sales. By pointing out how many items are left in your warehouse at the end of the month, this ratio also provides an estimate for how many products are sold. This can help to calculate how much stock needed to purchase to comfortably continue the sales without backorders. The formula to calculate Inventory to Sales Ratio KPI is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Inventory balance at the end of month / Sales for the month)</i></p>
<h6><strong>7. Perfect Order Rate KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Perfect order rate is a measurement of how many orders a company ships without any issues, such as damage, inaccuracies, or delays. Perfect Order Rate is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>[(No. of orders delivered on time&nbsp;/&nbsp;Total orders) x (No. of orders complete&nbsp;/&nbsp;Total orders) x (No. of orders damage free&nbsp;/&nbsp;Total orders) x (No. of orders with accurate documentation&nbsp;/&nbsp;Total orders)] x&nbsp;100</i></p>
<h6><strong>8. Gross Margin by Product KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>It is the amount of money a company keeps per dollar of sales. The formula for calculation is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>[(net sales&nbsp;–&nbsp;cost of goods sold) /&nbsp;net sales] x&nbsp;100</i></p>
<h6><strong>9. Gross Margin ROI KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>GMROI shows how much a company made compared to how much it invested in stock purchases. This metric measures how efficiently a company buys and sells its products. The formula for calculation is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Gross margin&nbsp;/&nbsp;average inventory cost</i></p>
<h6><strong>10. Excess Inventory KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Inventory that surpasses the projected demand in terms of raw material and finished goods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excess Inventory is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Current On-Hand Inventory - 3-month demand forecast)</i></p>
<h6><strong>11. Sell Through Rate KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>It is a comparison of the inventory amount sold and the amount of inventory received from a manufacturer. This helps demonstrate the efficiency of a supply chain. The formula is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Units sold&nbsp;/ Units received) x&nbsp;100</i></p>
<h6><strong>12. Lost Sales Ratio KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>It is the number of days a specific product is out of stock compared to the expected rate of sales for that product. It indicates when a company runs too lean on its stock. Lost Sales Ratio is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(No of days product is out of stock&nbsp;/&nbsp;365) x&nbsp;100</i></p>
<h6><strong>13. Stock-outs KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Stock-Outs, also known as out-of-stock items, is the percentage of items not available in inventory when a customer places an order. This metric shows a company’s ability to meet customer demand. The formula is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(No. of items not available in inventory&nbsp;/&nbsp;No. of items shipped) x&nbsp;100</i></p>
<h6><strong>14. Days on Hand (DOH) KPI:&nbsp;</strong></h6>
<p>DOH is used to determine how quickly a company utilizes the average inventory available at its disposal. It is also known as Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) and Days to Sell. DOH KPI is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Average Inventory Cost / (Cost of Goods Sold)) * 365</i></p>
<h6><strong>15. Back Order Rate KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>It is a measurement of the number of orders a company cannot fulfill when a customer places an order.</p>
<p>Backorder Rate KPI is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Delayed orders due to backorders&nbsp;/&nbsp;total orders placed) x&nbsp;100</i></p>
<h6><strong>16. Average Safety Inventory KPI:&nbsp;</strong></h6>
<p>Measures the average amount of inventory on hand when a replenishment order arrives. The formula for calculation is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Average[[maximum daily use x maximum lead time] –&nbsp;[average daily use x average lead time]]</i></p>
<h6><strong>17. Obsolete Inventory KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Inventory which turns out to be outdated.</p>
<h6><strong>18. Inventory Shrinkage KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Defined as excess inventory that is recorded in accounting but is no longer physically available, for reasons like theft, damage, or miscalculations. This KPI provides the value of inventory that is missing from your warehouse due to those factors. Inventory Shrinkage KPI is calculated by:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>[(Cost of recorded inventory – Cost of physically present inventory) / Cost of recorded inventory]</i></p>
<h6><strong>19. Average Inventory Cost KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Average inventory cost is the total cost of the inventory per number of units in that inventory.</p>
<p>Average Inventory Cost is calculated by:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Total cost of inventory / total units in inventory)</i></p>
<h6><strong>20. Cost of Goods Sold KPI:</strong></h6>
<p>Cost of goods sold (COGS) is literally the cost of producing the goods a company then sells. In the case of physical goods, it generally includes the value of existing inventory plus any related materials and direct labor costs incurred over the year. It may also include the cost of packing and transporting the goods to their end destination. COGS KPI formula is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Beginning Inventory + Purchases − Closing Inventory)</i></p>
