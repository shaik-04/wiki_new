<blockquote>
  <p>Our solution Sustainability is one solution for it. It all started with the idea of tracing emissions, wastes etc. until the most granular level. But how do we do that was the problem!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An idea led by Ashwin we started our journey for sustainability on 7th of July where he made us understand what and how different organizations measure and track the emissions, wastage, carbon footprints etc. and how organizations are not just responsible for direct but also indirect combustion.</p>
<p>With the idea in place, the design team( Abhijeet, Nandhitha &amp; Sanchita) took it to Miro board to conceptualize the idea and help the team visualize how the solution should be formed in terms of a product.</p>
<p>We first started with understanding who were our users? What were the different categories of the users and how their scope of work will be different from one another? Based on our discussions with Ashwin, we identified 3 personas which were - Chief Sustainability officer, sustainability team and operations/delivery team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We learnt the scope of work for each persona and started ideating around the journey for our first persona chief sustainability officer (CSO). With few initial discussions we were able to visualize what the user was seeing on his screen and how it would appear to him. With fast paced iterations we were able to come up with user journey and wireframes on the same day! And got them validated by Ashwin to ensure we were all looking at the same picture.</p>

<p>On 8th of July, we aimed at converting those wireframes into hi-if designs. Our first draft of the final designs was completely discarded as it didnâ€™t give amount of info and slicers which the user wants. What we also realized was that converting those wireframes to final designs lacked certain data elements. We knew how the user was seeing things and to a certain extent what was seen too. But the information seemed limited. We quickly got together to understand missing elements and stitch our story completely.</p>

<p>Post this discussion and with better clarity we were ready with what we call the first cut of Figma for sustainability! This so far has been the fastest that we have churned a prototype from an ideation stage. With constant collaboration the sustainability team made it possible to deliver its first prototype within two days!</p>
